In the coming years, artificial intelligence is probably going to change your life, and likely the entire world. But people have a hard time agreeing on exactly how. The following are excerpts from an interview where renowned computer science professor and AI expert Stuart Russell helps separate the sense from the nonsense.
\fs28 \AppleTypeServices \cb1 \

\fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 There\'92s a big difference between asking a human to do something and giving that as the objective to an AI system. When you ask a human to get you a cup of coffee, you don\'92t mean this should be their life\'92s mission, and nothing else in the universe matters. Even if they have to kill everybody else in Starbucks to get you the coffee before it closes\'97 they should do that. No, that\'92s not what you mean. All the other things that we mutually care about, they should factor into your behavior as well.
\fs28 \AppleTypeServices \cb1 \

\fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 And the problem with the way we build AI systems now is we give them a fixed objective. The algorithms require us to specify everything in the objective. And if you say, can we fix the acidification of the oceans? Yeah, you could have a catalytic reaction that does that extremely efficiently, but it consumes a quarter of the oxygen in the atmosphere, which would apparently cause us to die fairly slowly and unpleasantly over the course of several hours.
\fs28 \AppleTypeServices \cb1 \

\fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 So, how do we avoid this problem? You might say, okay, well, just be more careful about specifying the objective\'97 don\'92t forget the atmospheric oxygen. And then, of course, some side effect of the reaction in the ocean poisons all the fish. Okay, well I meant don\'92t kill the fish either. And then, well, what about the seaweed? Don\'92t do anything that\'92s going to cause all the seaweed to die. And on and on and on.
\fs28 \AppleTypeServices \cb1 \

\fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 And the reason that we don\'92t have to do that with humans is that humans often know that they don\'92t know all the things that we care about. If you ask a human to get you a cup of coffee, and you happen to be in the Hotel George Sand in Paris, where the coffee is 13 euros a cup, it\'92s entirely reasonable to come back and say, well, it\'92s 13 euros, are you sure you want it, or I could go next door and get one? And it\'92s a perfectly normal thing for a person to do. To ask, I\'92m going to repaint your house\'97 is it okay if I take off the drainpipes and then put them back? We don't think of this as a terribly sophisticated capability, but AI systems don\'92t have it because the way we build them now, they have to know the full objective. If we build systems that know that they don\'92t know what the objective is, then they start to exhibit these behaviors, like asking permission before getting rid of all the oxygen in the atmosphere.
\fs28 \AppleTypeServices \cb1 \

\fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 In all these senses, control over the AI system comes from the machine\'92s uncertainty about what the true objective is. And it\'92s when you build machines that believe with certainty that they have the objective, that\'92s when you get this sort of psychopathic behavior. And I think we see the same thing in humans.
\fs28 \AppleTypeServices \cb1 \

\fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 What happens when general purpose AI hits the real economy? How do things change? Can we adapt? This is a very old point. Amazingly, Aristotle actually has a passage where he says, look, if we had fully automated weaving machines and plectrums that could pluck the lyre and produce music without any humans, then we wouldn\'92t need any workers.
\fs28 \AppleTypeServices \cb1 \

\fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 That idea, which I think it was Keynes who called it technological unemployment in 1930, is very obvious to people. They think, yeah, of course, if the machine does the work, then I'm going to be unemployed.
\fs28 \AppleTypeServices \cb1 \

\fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 You can think about the warehouses that companies are currently operating for e-commerce, they are half automated. The way it works is that an old warehouse\'97 where you\'92ve got tons of stuff piled up all over the place and humans go and rummage around and then bring it back and send it off\'97 there\'92s a robot who goes and gets the shelving unit that contains the thing that you need, but the human has to pick the object out of the bin or off the shelf, because that\'92s still too difficult. But, at the same time, would you make a robot that is accurate enough to be able to pick pretty much any object within a very wide variety of objects that you can buy? That would, at a stroke, eliminate 3 or 4 million jobs?
\fs28 \AppleTypeServices \cb1 \

\fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 There's an interesting story that E.M. Forster wrote, where everyone is entirely machine dependent. The story is really about the fact that if you hand over the management of your civilization to machines, you then lose the incentive to understand it yourself or to teach the next generation how to understand it. You can see \'93WALL-E\'94 actually as a modern version, where everyone is enfeebled and infantilized by the machine, and that hasn\'92t been possible up to now.
\fs28 \AppleTypeServices \cb1 \

\fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 We put a lot of our civilization into books, but the books can\'92t run it for us. And so we always have to teach the next generation. If you work it out, it\'92s about a trillion person years of teaching and learning and an unbroken chain that goes back tens of thousands of generations. What happens if that chain breaks?
\fs28 \AppleTypeServices \cb1 \

\fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 I think that\'92s something we have to understand as AI moves forward. The actual date of arrival of general purpose AI\'97 you\'92re not going to be able to pinpoint, it isn\'92t a single day. It\'92s also not the case that it\'92s all or nothing. The impact is going to be increasing. So with every advance in AI, it significantly expands the range of tasks.
\fs28 \AppleTypeServices \cb1 \

\fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 So in that sense, I think most experts say by the end of the century, we\'92re very, very likely to have general purpose AI. The median is something around 2045. I'm a little more on the conservative side. I think the problem is harder than we think.
\fs28 \AppleTypeServices \cb1 \

\fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 I like what John McAfee, he was one of the founders of AI, when he was asked this question, he said, somewhere between five and 500 years. And we're going to need, I think, several Einsteins to make it happen.}
