NLTK Summary:
In addition to housing Mumtaz\'92s mausoleum, the plans included a garden, mosque, bazaar, and several caravanserais to house visiting merchants and diplomats. Directly across the river, Shah Jahan built another sprawling garden with a central pool that perfectly reflected the mausoleum. Perfecting the Italian stone-working technique, pietra dura, craftsmen used all manner of semi-precious stones to create intricate floral designs representing the eternal gardens of Paradise. To further establish an atmosphere of balance and harmony, the architects divided the complex into two spheres, representing the spiritual and earthly domains. This was a common motif in Mughal architecture, inspired by ancient Indian traditions associating white with spiritual purity and red with warriors and royalty. For the last eight years of his life, Shah Jahan lived under house arrest in Agra\'92s Fort, where he could see the Taj glimmering in the distance. After the Taj was completed in 1643, Shah Jahan retained some of these craftsmen for routine repairs, and hired Quran reciters, caretakers, and other staff to maintain the complex.
