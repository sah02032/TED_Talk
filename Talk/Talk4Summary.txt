NLTK Summary:
Remember, there's a wide range of settings that all fall under capitalism, meaning that one country's version can look very different from another's. It\'92s totally possible that inequality could be increasing in China\'92s version of capitalism, while it decreases in France\'92s. Just like tobacco companies denied the link between cigarettes and cancer, oil and gas companies denied or downplayed climate science for decades. In economies with high coordination, like the old USSR, the government dictated what the economy could\'97 and would\'97 produce. You can also think of this dial as controlling the number and extent of government regulations\'97 from tariffs on foreign goods to antitrust laws to regulations on net neutrality. But it\'92s also kind of irrelevant, since no country uses pure capitalism. Over here at 100%, markets are used to set the price of everything, even things like basic life-saving health care.

Gensim Summary:
\fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 The first dial controls who owns the capital. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 The second dial dictates how much control the government has over what gets produced. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 The third dial controls how extensively markets are used to set prices. Over here at 0%, we have economies with no markets, where the government sets all prices, and consumers have no say. Over here at 100%, markets are used to set the price of everything, even things like basic life-saving health care. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 So, capitalism isn\'92t just one type of economy\'97 it\'92s a wide range of possible economies, which makes answering the question of whether capitalism is broken, complicated. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 At the height of the Industrial Revolution, the dials were set pretty close to what we now call free market, or \'93laissez-faire\'94 capitalism. There were very few regulations, and economists of the time believed that capitalism\'92s \'93invisible hand\'94\'97 basically, individuals acting freely and in their own self-interest\'97 would produce optimal outcomes, both for the economy and for society. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 These days, no economy really practices pure \'93invisible hand\'94 capitalism, but some people are increasingly worried that today\'92s threats, like climate change and rising inequality, can\'92t be solved by any capitalist system. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Let\'92s look at climate change first. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Capitalist economies incentivize growth. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 And here\'92s another data point: in many European countries and Japan, the top 1%\'92s share of income came down from 20 to 25% in the early 1900s to 7 to 12% today. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 So, is capitalism increasing inequality or not? Remember, there's a wide range of settings that all fall under capitalism, meaning that one country's version can look very different from another's. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Capitalism, it seems, is a double-edged sword. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 So let\'92s break down the question we started with: is pure, \'93invisible hand\'94 capitalism, with all the dials set to the extremes, broken? But it\'92s also kind of irrelevant, since no country uses pure capitalism. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Is contemporary capitalism\'97 as it\'92s practiced in much of the world today\'97 broken? \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 The critical question is: can we fix contemporary capitalism by fiddling with the dials or restricting who can turn them, or do we need to tear the machine down and build a new one from scratch?}
