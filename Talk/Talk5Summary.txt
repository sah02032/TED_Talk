NLTK Summary:
Now I can tell you I still experience stigma today, whether it's people moving away from me in a restaurant or people not wanting to shake my hand. Now stigma is when people are seen in a negative way due to a certain characteristic, such as race, disability, sexuality or health challenges. Now people act like that out of a sense of fear, out of a sense of wanting to keep themselves safe. \fs28 \AppleTypeServices \cb1 \ \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Stigma also exists in unexpected places, like within health care.

Now people act like that out of a sense of fear, out of a sense of wanting to keep themselves safe. And in England, in 2020, for the first time in a decade, there was more new cases of HIV among heterosexual people than there were amongst gay and bisexual men. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 The truth is anyone can get the virus, and the only way to know your status is to get tested, but stigma acts as a barrier to testing, so new cases continue.

And we focus on that first point, education. We draw on the ability of sport to effect change, the love of celebrity and the compelling stories of those living with HIV can bring to change people's behavior and understanding, whether that be through media engagements, a podcast with others who have experienced stigma, or live, on-the-ground initiatives. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 And so the fight continues, because in some countries around the world, new cases of HIV are rising, and in all of these countries, stigma continues to exist. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Now, the wings underneath my tattoo ... \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Thank you so much.\cb1 \\
