NLTK Summary:
Find an entry point, identify a gap, and then find something doable with which to fill that gap. Another organization I founded, the Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious Understanding, found a doable way to fill that gap by guiding major corporations in accommodating religious beliefs in the workplace. And we were there to try and figure out how we can get aid to the Syrian people who were enduring the worst humanitarian crisis since World War II. The doable way to fill that gap was to set up the first sex crimes unit in the country. That gave us something doable with which to fill that gap. It was now official government policy to open the border so that aid from other countries could be facilitated and sent in to Syria. But by working with these unlikely partnerships, we were able to help more than two and a half million war victims and still counting.

Gensim Summary:
What happens when a Syrian refugee, an Israeli aid worker and an American Jew walk into a room? \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 No, this is not the start of a really bad joke, I promise. And we were there to try and figure out how we can get aid to the Syrian people who were enduring the worst humanitarian crisis since World War II. We figured out a way to get aid into Syria through Israel. I applied a three-step process that I've used in a bunch of other settings, and I'm hoping that those three steps will be useful to any of you who want to do some good in the face of any of the myriad overwhelming conflicts that we're facing today, including Ukraine. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 When I read a report on the Syrian war, it hit me very hard and it felt very personal. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 So as one person ... When you're confronted with something that you know needs to be changed, you have to find an entry point. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 I saw an opportunity to build bridges while also saving lives. Israel shares a border with that part of Syria. It's easy to get aid into southwest Syria from the Israeli side of the Golan Heights. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 In September 2016, the Israeli government launched Operation Good Neighbor. It was now official government policy to open the border so that aid from other countries could be facilitated and sent in to Syria. So soon after, once we were able to get Operation Good Neighbor going, soon after, enormous cargo containers of aid -- many of them bearing goods from Syrian organizations -- were being unloaded in Israeli ports by Israeli soldiers, sent over to the Golan Heights and from there, our partners on the ground in Syria would pick up the aid and distribute it to an area with a population of 1.3 million people. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 We delivered 120 million dollars of aid this way. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 It wasn't easy and it wasn't without hiccups. But by working with these unlikely partnerships, we were able to help more than two and a half million war victims and still counting. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Now, here's the great news. The doable way to fill that gap was to set up the first sex crimes unit in the country. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 I've done the same thing with large corporations. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Well, it's been a long road to Syria from my early forays as a professional change agent. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Thank you. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 (Applause)}
