\fs28 \AppleTypeServices \cb1 \ \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Information is power and information is everything, like questions, but also data, context, emerging insights, work in progress, even water cooler conversations. So we really need to get many minds together, more resources, more capabilities, and we need to do it effectively and sustainably. Let's imagine a team working together on a green transition strategy, and the following conversation is inspired by a team I was part of. At work, whenever a task is my idea, I do it a bit better than when it's someone else telling me. It drives better quality when we capture ideas day and night and when we distribute quality assurance across the full team. That's not going to help us do what we need to to create a better future. Communication often flows from top to bottom along just one line, which means it doesn't match the complexity of problems which move in several directions at once.

Gensim Summary:
\fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 My point is, we think of leadership as a role for the few and the rest get to just lean back. Now, that, of course, might be OK for an event like this, but I believe that leadership by the few, it's not going to help us solve the problems ahead. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 What if leadership could be for the many? And for all you leaders out there thinking it won't work, maybe in some cases it won't. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 I'm a physicist turned management consultant working with global companies on strategy, artificial intelligence and digital transformation. At work, whenever a task is my idea, I do it a bit better than when it's someone else telling me. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Being curious and complacent, I often ask: Why do we do things this way? \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 A typical view of leadership is a hierarchical organization chart. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 So in a network instead, everyone's in charge and we replace power of the few with influence of the many. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 To empower many more to lead, to move leadership from the few to the many, we each need to let go of a bit of power. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 The first thing we can do is remove labels. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 And Joe goes, "Let's ask accounting." \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Said no one, ever. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 But maybe we should. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Now that we have gotten rid of those labels, I have another uncomfortable idea for you. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Or, you know, the feeling of, "Had I just known that, I would have done so much better." Let's imagine a team working together on a green transition strategy, and the following conversation is inspired by a team I was part of. Not in the hierarchical sense, but in the sense of taking lead for solving a problem by listing questions and involving people. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Information is power and information is everything, like questions, but also data, context, emerging insights, work in progress, even water cooler conversations. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Wait. And if you catch yourself thinking, \'93I can\'92t share that,\'94 I want you to test again and ask, why? It drives better quality when we capture ideas day and night and when we distribute quality assurance across the full team. But the best of it all, we get greater ownership through early involvement of people like customers and stakeholders, avoiding that classic show-and-tell, the one-way presentation. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 You can probably tell I could go on and on, but there is one more uncomfortable thing we have to do. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Kindness. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Kind or unkind becomes especially clear when someone makes a mistake. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Bharat goes, "Thanks for sharing. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Samuel, "Better now than never." \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Jenny, "No mistakes would mean we weren't moving fast enough." \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 The formal leaders in this conversation, they didn't think much about it when this happened, but the team members have later come back and said that this was a truly defining moment for the team culture. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 And the results? \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 When everyone is a leader, it allows us to do more and do it better. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Distributed leadership is a movement that goes beyond the traditional leader. People are much more likely to do things if they feel a sense of ownership and "it was my idea" versus being told what to do. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Now, none of this is magic, but it won't happen if traditional leaders block it. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 So when I now ask you, who's in charge, who\'92s the leader today? \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Yes, you. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Thank you. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 (Applause)}
