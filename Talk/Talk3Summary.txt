NLTK Summary:
But given the rush to get the data, it would have been hard to collect because people would have had to track cycles before the vaccine. The preclinical data for the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine showed no impact on fertility in animals that would lead researchers to suspect there would be issues with humans. This, understandably, made people nervous about a potential effect on fertility or an unknown effect of the vaccine. \fs28 \AppleTypeServices \cb1 \ \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 After the COVID-19 vaccine was rolled out, there were reports online of people experiencing irregular periods or changes in their menstrual cycle. \fs28 \AppleTypeServices \cb1 \ \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 So I want to address some of these worries by talking about how a vaccine becomes a vaccine in the first place. The only group that was more likely to show a meaningful difference in their menstrual cycle length were those who received two doses of the vaccine in one cycle. Researchers don\'92t move on from the preclinical testing phase until they prove that the vaccine is unlikely to harm anyone.

COVID-19 vaccination saves lives for everyone, especially pregnant people and their babies. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 One of the early stages of vaccine development involves exploratory research. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 While mRNA vaccines are new to the public, researchers have been studying and working with them for decades. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Once the exploratory stage is finished, researchers move on to the preclinical stage, where testing is done in petri dishes or on animals. The goal of preclinical tests is to see if the vaccine truly works on the pathogen -- in this case, the virus that causes COVID-19 -- and also to test the safety of a vaccine. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Once the FDA approves, the next step is the clinical development or clinical trials, testing in humans, which is a three-phase process. Now, it's true that clinical trials for the COVID-19 vaccines didn't include pregnant people, and that's not unusual. The preclinical data for the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine showed no impact on fertility in animals that would lead researchers to suspect there would be issues with humans. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Even after the vaccine has been approved by the FDA and made available to the public, there's still work to be done. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 After the COVID-19 vaccine was rolled out, there were reports online of people experiencing irregular periods or changes in their menstrual cycle. But given the rush to get the data, it would have been hard to collect because people would have had to track cycles before the vaccine. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 And we've continued to gather data. We now see the importance of vaccination for those who are pregnant as the risk of mortality in pregnancy with COVID-19 is 1.6 percent. We also now have data showing that infants from people vaccinated during pregnancy do have antibodies to help protect them from COVID-19. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 If your goal is a healthy pregnancy, one of the best ways to achieve that is by getting vaccinated.

SpaCy Summary:
And because the endometrium, the lining of the uterus that sheds during a period, is part of our immune system, it is theoretically possible a vaccine could have a temporary effect in the same way a vaccine causes temporary swelling in the lymph nodes for some people or a temporary fever. The preclinical data for the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine showed no impact on fertility in animals that would lead researchers to suspect there would be issues with humans.  The goal of preclinical tests is to see if the vaccine truly works on the pathogen -- in this case, the virus that causes COVID-19 -- and also to test the safety of a vaccine. Researchers responded to the concerns raised online and looked into data from almost 4,000 people who tracked their cycles using an app and compared data from the vaccinated group to those who didn't get vaccinated. After the COVID-19 vaccine was rolled out, there were reports online of people experiencing irregular periods or changes in their menstrual cycle.
