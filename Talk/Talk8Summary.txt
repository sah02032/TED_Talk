NLTK Summary:
To us because we're all enamored with going carbon zero, carbon negative, carbon neutral. If you want to convert that to carbon dioxide, that's about 33 tons of carbon dioxide being kept out of the atmosphere on the body of a single whale. The whale captures carbon on her body, and she gives birth to baby whales who also grow up to capture carbon on their body. All these companies and countries that made commitments to carbon zero, carbon negative, carbon neutral. Well, it turns out that the whales grab so much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere -- by the way, they eat and they poop. Imagine -- because those elephants are grabbing carbon in the trees -- they can sell the carbon offsets of their elephants. But I just wanted to value one thing, which is what is the value of their carbon sequestration service to us?

Gensim Summary:
\fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Now you have to understand, at that point in time, I knew nothing about blue whales, or whales in general. It was already known in the science that whales capture so much carbon on their body and indirectly. And that's, of course, very important for us because we are all facing the climate calamity and we are all talking about how to grab carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Well, it turns out that the whales grab so much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere -- by the way, they eat and they poop. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 So how does the whale system work? Now how much carbon dioxide do they grab from the atmosphere? \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Now larger creatures called krill love to eat phytoplankton directly or indirectly. If you want to convert that to carbon dioxide, that's about 33 tons of carbon dioxide being kept out of the atmosphere on the body of a single whale. If you want to visualize that, that\'92s the work of 1,500 trees on the body of a single whale. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 But those guys, because they eat a lot, what do you do next? And when the phyto gets more active, it grabs more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. So just imagine: the whales, they capture carbon on their body. And through their poop they also fertilize phyto, making phyto even more active, grabbing more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 So in a sense, the whales are incredible allies in the fight against climate change. In fact, they're dying because our current economic system puts a zero value on a living whale. The value of a living whale is zero, zero dollars, zero in any currency. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 I'm a financial economist. But I just wanted to value one thing, which is what is the value of their carbon sequestration service to us? \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Would you like to know how much? \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 RC: At least three million dollars. But I just wanted to tell the good news that I heard on that boat. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 RC: Their cousins on land, the elephants in the forests of Africa, in the Congo Basin, they do the same thing. Turns out the way they walk and they eat and they poop, they increase carbon sequestration in the trees, in the forests between seven and 14 percent. Just imagine, just by frolicking around, they're helping us to grab carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and fix it. And you ask yourself, what is the value of a single elephant's carbon sequestration service? \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Audience: Yes! \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Audience: Yes! \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Audience: Yes! \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Audience: Yes! Seagrass, saltmarsh mangroves, kelp forests, peatlands, wetlands -- these are living systems that suck in so much carbon dioxide beyond your imagination, and they keep it forever in their roots as long as you leave them alone and you look after them. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 So ... \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 So ... \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Question is, what do you do with this? \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 That economy is going to deliver for us sustainable and shared prosperity for all, big and small, all creatures on this planet. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 From there we can build -- In order to build that economy, we need three things. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Three things. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Gabon has 57,000 elephants. Gabon can sell the carbon offsets of its elephants. Those elephants, by the way, they walk, they poop, just being, having babies, doing whatever they do, they help carbon sequestration in the forests. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Who would buy these carbon offsets? \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Once we do that -- Notice what it is.

So if I were to track the whale over her lifetime and keep track of all these dividends into the future, and then multiply that by the price of carbon, and discount that all the way to the present, I can figure out what is the present value, discounted present value, of the lifetime earnings of a single whale. The whale captures carbon on her body, and she gives birth to baby whales who also grow up to capture carbon on their body.
