NLTK Summary:
Like in every city, construction is a big emission source, and in Oslo, the municipality accounts for approximately 20 percent of everything that is being built. I am here to tell you that climate solutions actually make a better city and a better quality of life for everyone. \fs28 \AppleTypeServices \cb1 \ \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 As head of the climate agency in Oslo, the Klosterenga construction site is a climate measure I'm really excited about. \fs28 \AppleTypeServices \cb1 \ \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 In 2017, the city decided to use procurement to drive markets for developing technologies we needed to reach the climate goals. This is very good news because mobility is the biggest emission source in the city, accounting for approximately 50 percent of our total emissions. The city began, years ago, to develop as a city for walkers and bikers. Oslo's climate measures have given the city cleaner air, less noise, safer and more human-centered streets.

Gensim Summary:
Let me start by showing you a construction site in my home city of Oslo. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 As head of the climate agency in Oslo, the Klosterenga construction site is a climate measure I'm really excited about. Klosterenga is close to being a zero-emission construction site run by the city of Oslo. And running zero-emission sites is just one example of the Oslo climate strategy. Oslo's climate measures have given the city cleaner air, less noise, safer and more human-centered streets. Some of the measures were controversial when first introduced, but now a majority of the population thinks -- even those who are not that concerned about climate change -- think that we are creating a better city. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 For too long, discussions about climate change have been about sacrifice. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 So lesson number one, confronting climate change is about creating better cities and better quality of life for everyone. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 The second lesson is about being ambitious. In 2015, the city council set a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 95 percent by 2030 without purchasing any carbon offsets. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 In my experience, the key challenges of achieving climate targets is that the division of responsibility we see on global, national and local levels. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Our a solution to this fragmentation was this document: the Oslo Climate Budget, which we put forward for the first time in 2016. This is a measure that has been planned in the climate budget since 2017, and it will be the department of business development and public ownership, with its specific skills, that will have the responsibility for implementing it. An important point is that every agency will have to report on the status of all their climate work as a part of the ordinary budget process three times a year. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 So let me go back to construction. Three years ago, we broke ground on the piloting of the world\'92s first zero-emission construction site. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 In 2017, the city decided to use procurement to drive markets for developing technologies we needed to reach the climate goals. Like in every city, construction is a big emission source, and in Oslo, the municipality accounts for approximately 20 percent of everything that is being built. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 So fourth lesson, never, ever underestimate how much you can change by being a demanding customer. We plan to gradually introduce requirements for zero emissions in all construction sites in the city of Oslo, both private and public, by 2030. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 In the last years, the city\'92s quality of air has improved significantly. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Transition to electric mobility has been supported by a wide range of policies. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Everyone probably knows that Norway is an oil and gas-rich nation and many might think that this is the reason why we can invest in climate solutions in Oslo. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Sometimes technology development changes markets very rapidly. Our climate budget had a goal of reaching zero-emission public transport by 2028. Our latest climate budget analysis shows that we are up for reaching a reduction with the adaptable measures by 62 percent by 2030. emissions produced outside Oslo that are related to the activities and life in the city. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 Let me finish by telling you how I move around in the city. \fs32 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb2 And increasingly, if you walk past a construction site in Oslo, you will hear no noise.
